This is a small helper application for the board game "Ancient Horror" 

Many fans of board games have heard about Ancient Horror as one of the most interesting board adventures, but there is one difficulty: preparing for the game for inexperienced players takes from 40 minutes to an hour of time and one of the most difficult conditions is the compilation of a deck of myths
